# Python - Masterclass

This repository contains codebase of a Masterclass for learning the basics of Python programming required for DevOps. 

The Masterclass cover various fundamental concepts and topics in Python, including variables, data types, loops, conditionals, functions, and modules.

The Masterclass even has a small project introduction where you can use Python with AWS.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Masterclass, you will need to have Python installed on your local machine. If you don't have Python installed, you can download and install the latest version from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once you have Python installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine by running the following command in your terminal:

`git clone https://github.com/LondheShubham153/python-masterclass.git`

## Running the Masterclass code

The Masterclass is organized into several modules, each covering a specific topic in Python. To run a tutorial, simply navigate to the module directory and run the corresponding Python file in your terminal. For example, to run the tutorial on variables, navigate to the `basics` directory and run the `hello.py` file:

```
cd basics
python hello.py
```


The output of the file will be displayed in your terminal.
